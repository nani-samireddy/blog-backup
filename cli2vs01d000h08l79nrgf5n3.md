## Flutter Stateless Widgets

**1\. What are Stateless Widgets?  
**A Stateless Widget is a widget that cannot change its internal state once it is created. It means that every time a stateless widget is rebuilt, it will rebuild with the same configuration.

**2\. How do Stateless Widgets work?  
**Stateless Widgets are built using the `build()` method, which returns a widget tree that describes the widget’s configuration. Since they cannot change their internal state, the `build()` method will always return the same widget tree.

**3\. When should you use Stateless Widgets?  
**Stateless Widgets are useful for displaying static content that does not change. They are also useful for optimizing performance, as they are more efficient than Stateful Widgets.

**4\. Differences between Stateless and Stateful Widgets  
**The main difference between Stateless and Stateful Widgets is that Stateful Widgets can change their internal state during runtime, while Stateless Widgets cannot. This means that Stateful Widgets are better suited for handling user input and dynamic content.

**5\. Examples of when to use Stateless Widgets  
**Stateless Widgets are commonly used for displaying static content, such as images, text, and icons. They are also useful for creating reusable UI elements, such as buttons and navigation bars.

**6\. How to create a Stateless Widget  
**To create a Stateless Widget in Flutter, you must extend the `StatelessWidget` class and override the `build()` method. Here is an example:

```dart

class MyStatelessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
 @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
 return Container(
 child: Text(‘Hello, World!’),
 );
 }
}
```

In this example, the **MyStatelessWidget** class extends the **StatelessWidget** class and overrides the **build()** method to return a `Container` widget that contains a **Text** widget with the text “**Hello, World!**”.
